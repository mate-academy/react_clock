1. Add buttons `Show Clock` and `Hide Clock` in the App changing `isClockVisible` variable in the `App` state.
1. The `Clock` should not be rendered when `isClockVisible` is `false`.
1. Change the `Clock` component to print the time not only on the page but also in the `DevTools` console.
    - Stop the timer when the `Clock` is hidden.
1. Check if it works correctly:
    - Hide and show the `Clock` several times and leave it visible
    - The time in the console should be printed only once each second
